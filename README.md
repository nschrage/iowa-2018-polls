Comparing NYT Poll Results in IA03 and IA04

[Link to Rpub](http://rpubs.com/nschrage/iowa_polls)

Wanted to see how IA03 (district that leans the most democratic in Iowa) compared to IA04 (Republican Rep. Steve King's district)

NYT Covers this in more detail [here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/elections-poll-ia04-3.html)

Looked at presidential approval ratings by age -- huge partisan difference, interesting to see that young people on the whole are dissatisfied with POTUS.
